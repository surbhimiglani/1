# 1 i am again feeing low...dont know the reason...may be depressed out of my classes...coz i am not used to attedin so much of them
...may be i am missing my dance society...depressed of my failure over there each and every single tym...have a great regret that
i could have done better but something or to be specific my lack of activeness always pulled me back...same is the reason today..the 
thought of practicing again going to hawa mahal for 3 hours scares me...but the feeling..the happiest feeling in this world when i 
come back fulfills everything..also i should not be confused between going home and dancing today...coz this is the only main reason
that i didint go home today...going home is a pleasure for me as well as my family..they miss me and i miss them..but we have certain
priorities in our life that should be kept at the
top alwaya...i chose this and i should be specific to the direction of competing at a higher level with my skills...and going home today 
will make every1 feel happy but the real happiness of succes which i deserve will only be achieved if i give priority to the most imp 
things today...thinking about others happiness and listening to others and moving in my life there way will no way help me be happy 
the way i want and i deserve..so i completely know what is right for me...and do hell with every1 who think my decision is wrong.
.i dont care...if i would have went home today..that would not have been wrong but that would be my inactive part of lyf decisions...so
staying here or not today is right or not may be the question by others but for me it is my priority and is always correct..I love u surbhi 
and always will..othesr do or not...i do not care...stay cheerful and happy..always by ur side
